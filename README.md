# elevation-sources

This repository contains comprehensive topobathymetric digital elevation model (DEM) sources for both CONUS (Continental United States) and OCONUS (Outside Continental United States) domains. These include the Pacific Coast, Atlantic and Gulf Coast, Hawai'i, Puerto Rico & the U.S. Virgin Islands, Great Lakes, and Alaska. These datasets supported the development of the National Water Model v3 Coastal Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) and SCHISM (Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model) modeling. The repository also forms the foundation of the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) for the Office of Water Prediction (OWP) Hydrofabric Modeling Surface, supporting high-resolution flood inundation mapping and modeling. Datasets processed by OWP's Hydrofabric team will be accessible through spatial.water.noaa.gov (coming soon).
